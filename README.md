# TripSeeker

Searchs for Ryanair flights and allows to filter by matching flights from different origin airports with the same destination matching the dates.
Note that class TripSeeker only searches for individual flights (from origin to destination and return). While TripChecker allows to make combinations from different origins and same destination.

Done using Python 3.11. Depends on ryanair-py.
